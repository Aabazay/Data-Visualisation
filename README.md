-----------------------------------
#The Computer Misuse Act protects personal data held by organisations from unauthorised access and modification. Unauthorised access to computer material is illegal; This refers to entering a computer system without permission (hacking).
#A Data Protection Policy is a statement that sets out how your organisation protects personal data. It is a set of principles, rules and guidelines that informs how you will ensure ongoing compliance with data protection laws. 
#Police and Justice Act 2006 (Computer Misuse) means any unauthorised acts with intent to impair operation of computer is illegal and the penalty for conviction is imprisonment for a maximum of five years or a fine or both.
What are the rights of consumers in terms of their data? The right to erasure, the right to restrict processing, the right to data portability and the right to object.

I think those Policies and Procedures explained above are the most important ones when dealing with Data ‘Wealth of Nations’. It’s a Data set that contains information about capitol of certain Countries and it’s important to keep that safe, but any Data given to us by customers need to be protected.
