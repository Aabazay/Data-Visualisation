-----------------------------------
-The Computer Misuse Act protects personal data held by organisations from unauthorised access and modification. Unauthorised access to computer material is illegal; This refers to entering a computer system without permission (hacking).

-A Data Protection Policy is a statement that sets out how your organisation protects personal data. It is a set of principles, rules and guidelines that informs how you will ensure ongoing compliance with data protection laws.

-Police and Justice Act 2006 (Computer Misuse) means any unauthorised acts with intent to impair operation of computer is illegal and the penalty for conviction is imprisonment for a maximum of five years or a fine or both.
What are the rights of consumers in terms of their data? The right to erasure, the right to restrict processing, the right to data portability and the right to object.

I think those Policies and Procedures explained above are the most important ones when dealing with Data ‘Wealth of Nations’. It’s a Data set that contains information about capitol of certain Countries and it’s important to keep that safe, but any Data given to us by customers need to be protected.

Step one of my assignments to protect the workbook so anyone looking into the workbook cannot alter the information.
Step two is to highlight the C column and change currency from $ to £. 
Step three is to turn the GDP sheet into table, I have also added the option to filter the data.
Step four is to filter the data to show only year 2019. I have clicked onto the filter option and deselected all the years apart from 2019.
Step five is to create a chart that displays the Rank, Country, and GDP-per capita (PPP), To do this I have selected all the Data and pressed on Insert, then used the Recommended Charts option and chose the desired chart.
Step six is to edit the chart created. I have used the options available to edit the chart after double clicking onto the chart.
Step seven is to move the chart to a new sheet tab and label with a suitable name. I have right clicked on the chart and used the Copy option. Then I have opened a new sheet and pasted it there. To rename the sheet I have right clicked on the new sheet tab and chose the Rename option.    
Step eight is to create a sort for the top 20 highest ranking countries.
Step nine is to create a new Bar chart to display the 20 highest ranking countries displaying the table and chart underneath. I have followed the same step as before, highlighting the data then using the Recommended Charts option.
Step ten is to fill the background with a colour. I have right clicked on the background then used the fill in option to choose the desired colour, I have chosen light blue. 
Step 11 is to create three macro buttons (Print, Save, Copy). I have done this by creating 3 desired shapes and recording the macros step by step then assigning them to the correct shapes.

--------------------------------

I have now created a dashboard using Tableu. 
Using the Excel data provided I have uploaded the data onto Tableu, I have set the relationship between the sheets as Country equals Country, because that’s what they have all had in common. 
I have then created five different graphs and two maps to allow the client to see the Data in a visual that’s easy to read. I have applied filter to make sure only top 20 ranked Countries are displayed. I have then created a dashboard that is going to be shown to the client, I have uploaded four charts and a map that in my opinion are the best way to explain the Data to the client. 


During this assignment I have not experienced diffulties, it was pretty straight forward.
